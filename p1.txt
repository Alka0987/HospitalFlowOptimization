This project is a Hospital Queue Prediction System designed to optimize resource allocation and improve patient experience by predicting how busy the hospital will be and how long patients will wait.

Here is the complete story of what we have built:

1. The Goal
The objective was to move beyond simple averages and use Queueing Theory combined with Machine Learning to predict:

System Health: How long the queue is ($L_q$), how fast patients arrive ($\lambda$), and how fast they are served ($\mu$).
Patient Experience: Exactly how many minutes a specific patient will wait.
2. The Data
We used real hospital log files:

Scheduled Patients: sourced from 
F1.csv
, 
F2.csv
, 
F3.csv
.
Emergency Patients: sourced from 
F4.csv
.
Staff Capacity: Daily roster data from 
hospital_roster.csv
.
3. The Methodology (How it works)
We built a pipeline in two stages:

Stage A: Data Processing (
data_processing.py
) We didn't just feed raw times into the model. We engineered Queueing Theory Metrics:

Arrival Rate ($\lambda$): Patients arriving per hour.
Service Rate ($\mu$): Patients completed per hour.
Workload ($\rho$): The ratio of Arrivals to Capacity (how "stressed" the system is).
Physical Wait: The actual time (in minutes) between a patient arriving and their exam beginning.
Stage B: Model Training (
train_model.py
) We trained Machine Learning models to learn the patterns between "Time of Day + Staff Count + Patient Type" and the "Wait Time".

Architecture: We started with XGBoost, but switched to Random Forest (as per your request) for its robustness.
Features:
One-Hot Encoding: We explicitly taught the model the difference between Emergency and Scheduled patients.
Temporal Features: Hour of Day, Day of Week.
Capacity: Total Staff on Duty.
4. What the Model Predicts Now
We actually have two types of models running:

The System Model (Macro View):
Predicts Average Queue Length for the next hour.
Accuracy: It is correct within ~0.85 patients.
The Individual Model (Micro View):
Predicts Exact Wait Time for a specific person walking in the door.
Accuracy: It predicts the wait time within ~4.3 minutes.
Summary of Success
We successfully turned raw csv logs into a predictive engine that knows the difference between a busy Monday morning Emergency rush and a quiet Sunday afternoon, and can tell you confidently: "If you join the queue now, you will wait about 25 minutes."
