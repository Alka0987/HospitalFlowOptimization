# HospitalFlowOptimization
Developed a Big Data analytics solution to analyze and optimize patient flow in a hospital emergency department. The project involved processing both real-time streaming and historical hospital data to predict patient arrivals, identify operational bottlenecks, and improve overall workflow efficiency.  
The data files are too large for GitHub, so download them first, set up Kafka, and then run the project.
